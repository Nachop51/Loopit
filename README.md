Loopit is a social media platform for programmers to share their code with the world. Create a profile, upload your code, and share it with your friends and followers.

# Getting Started
Once the user enters loopit-mvp.com, he must either register if he does not have an account created, or log in. Once this step is done, the user will enter the main Loopit page, and will have access to all the functionalities of the page!
